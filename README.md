Jenkins Item Forwarder Plugin
=============================

When renaming or moving jobs in Jenkins, links to the previous location in external documentation, notification emails, etc. suddenly become invalid. This plugin allows you to create *Forwarder Items* that inform users about the change, and tell them the new location of renamed items. These can be hidden from regular views by filtering for the item type using e.g. the [View Job Filters Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/View+Job+Filters).
